# Single Node OpenStack Setup on Ubuntu and Snort Detection of TCP SYN Flood

## Description
This project set up a single-node architecture of OpenStack using DevStack on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and then set up the attacker and victim machines in the OpenStack environment. The victim machine is then used to set the Snort detection rule to detect TCP SYN Flood attack from the attacker machine
